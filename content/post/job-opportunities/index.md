Finding open positions is easy. You go to [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/), [Monster.com](https://www.monster.com/), [Google Jobs](https://jobs.google.com/about/), etc., and you'll apparently find hundreds of different open positions that companies need to fill.

Especially in mid-2020, during the height of the [COVID19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), I had a feeling as if there were many more open positions than the year before. But still, many of my friends, many of my LinkedIn contacts, and myself included were still searching for a job – a new opportunity to grow, learn, and create a meaningful impact.

## Some (maybe) useful websites

During my time searching for opportunities, I slowly created a small list of interesting websites that might hopefully be helpful to you (the reader), or maybe one of your friends or colleagues.

==> [Jobs & Career Opportunities – Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16YPfy7nZNBs99dtoG-xCPJZMQOynBgWAVA9omq2PdHE/edit?usp=sharing)

Feel free to share it with anyone you think could benefit from this; or anyone who maybe just need a little push and motivation to keep looking for a new job. There are certainly many open positions out there, and everyone will eventually find a position where she/he/they will fit in.

I wish you – or whoever is looking for a job – all the best and may you stay positive, and stay healthy!

## European Union (EU)

On a side note, the European Union (EU) tries to make it easier for European citizens to share their ideas, concerns, and opinions related to the future of Europe: [Conference on the Future of Europe](https://futureu.europa.eu/?locale=en)

_The Conference on the Future of Europe is a unique and timely opportunity for European citizens to debate on Europe’s challenges and priorities._
